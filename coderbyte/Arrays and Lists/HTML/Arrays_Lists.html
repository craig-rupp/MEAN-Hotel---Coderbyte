<h4>The challenge is to find all the pairs of two integers in an unsorted array that sum up to a given S. For example, if the array is [3, 5, 2, -4, 8, 11] and the sum is 7, your program should return [[11, -4], [2, 5]] because 11 + -4 = 7 and 2 + 5 = 7.</h4>
<h4>The input for this problem will be an array of numbers representing a set, which only contains unique numbers, and your goal is to print every possible set combination, otherwise known as the power set. For example:
input set = [1, 2, 3]
power set = [[], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3] [1, 2, 3]]</h4>
